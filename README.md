ðŸŒ¿ Plant Care Assistant Chatbot ðŸ¤–
Project Overview
The Plant Care Assistant Chatbot is a conversational AI designed to help users diagnose common plant issues, provide tailored care instructions (watering, light, soil), and offer general plant advice. It uses a hybrid approach of rule-based logic and Generative AI (LLMs) for informative and contextual responses. The application is built in Python using Streamlit for the frontend and LangChain for the core AI logic and memory management.

ðŸ”— Live Application
The most up-to-date version of the Plant Care Assistant is publicly deployed on Streamlit Cloud and ready to use!

Live App URL: https://plantcarebot-gjehlqra3kxje4j9c9ey8n.streamlit.app/

How to Use the Live App
1. Open the URL in your browser.

2. Start Chatting: Use the input box at the bottom to ask about your plants.

Start with context: "Hi, I have a Monstera."

Ask for diagnosis: "My leaves are turning yellow."

Ask for advice: "How much light does it need?"

3. Context is Key: The bot remembers previous messages in your session, so you don't have to repeat the plant name.

ðŸš€ Local Development Setup
This section is for developers who want to run the project locally, inspect the code, or contribute new features.

Prerequisites
You need Python 3.10+ installed on your system.

1. Setup Environment and Dependencies
To get the project running, create a dedicated environment and install the required packages.

# Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub)
# git clone <your-repo-link>
# cd plant_bot

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv plant_bot_env
source plant_bot_env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
#.\plant_bot_env\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install required packages (from requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Configure OpenAI API Key

The chatbot relies on the OpenAI API for its intelligent responses. You must set your key as an environment variable for the local version to work.

Get your OpenAI API Key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys].

Set the key as an environment variable in your terminal session:

# On Mac/Linux/Git Bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-secret-key-goes-here'

# On Windows Command Prompt
# set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-secret-key-goes-here

3. Run the Application
Execute the Streamlit application from the root directory:

streamlit run app.py

The application will launch in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

## Tech Stack and Architecture

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python 3.10+ | Core development language. |
| **Frontend/Deployment** | [Streamlit] | Fast development of the interactive web UI and hosting platform. |
| **Backend/AI** | [LangChain] | Orchestrates the LLM, handles chat history/memory (`RunnableWithMessageHistory`), and defines the conversational chain. |
| **LLM** | [OpenAI API] (GPT-3.5/4) | Powers the generative text responses. |
| **Data Storage** | Python Dictionary / JSON | Stores the structured plant care data for **Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG)**. |

Future Enhancements

Symptom ML Model: Integrate a scikit-learn classifier for basic symptom-to-diagnosis mapping.

Persistent History: Replace in-memory history with a database (e.g., Redis) for chat context persistence across browser reloads.
